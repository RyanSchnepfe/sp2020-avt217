    <h1>Philter of Love</h1>
    <p>The next time you see a creature within 10 minutes after drinking this philter, you become charmed by that creature for <a href="P4.html">1 hour</a>. If the creature is of a species and gender you are normally attracted to, you regard it as your true love while you are charmed. This potion's rose-hued, effervescent liquid contains one easy-to-miss bubble shaped like a heart.</p>
