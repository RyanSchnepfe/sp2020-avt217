    <h1>Potion of Diminution</h1>
    <p>When you drink this potion, you gain the <a href="P10.html">"reduce"</a> effect of the enlarge/reduce spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the potion's liquid continuously contracts to a tiny bead and then expands to color the clear liquid around it. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.</p>
