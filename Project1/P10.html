    <h1>Potion of Growth</h1>
    <p>When you drink this potion, you gain the "enlarge" effect of the <a href="P6.html">enlarge/reduce</a> spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The <a href="P2.html">red</a> in the potion's liquid continuously <a href="P8.html">expands</a> from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.</p>
