    <h1>Potion of Growth</h1>
    <p>When you drink this potion, you gain the "enlarge" effect of the <li><a href="P6.html">enlarge/reduce</a></li> spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the potion's liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.</p>
