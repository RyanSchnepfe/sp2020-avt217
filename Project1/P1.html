    <h1>Oil of Etherealness</h1>
    <p>Beads of this cloudy gray oil form on the outside of its container and quickly <li><a href="P8.html">evaporate</a></li>. The <li><a href="P2.html">oil</a></li> can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment it's wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes <li><a href="P3.html">10</a></li> minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of the etherealness spell for 1 hour.</p>
