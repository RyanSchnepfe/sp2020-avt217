        <p>A land of dense forests, high reaching mountain peaks, and scathing deserts, Egar is the home to a bewildering number of adventurers and monsters.</p>

        <p>The smallest of the four continents of Yondur, Egar formed from the primordial mists in the year -35000 ET (Egar Timeline). Despite its relatively young age, volcanic activity in Egar is limited to a few regions (namely in the north western corner of Urkbauer) and mountain ranges are deemed to be young by scholars and magical researchers. One such mountain range, the High Dragon’s Teeth, splits the continent into an eastern and western half.  To the east lies a temperate region. Forests are common in the east, as are a smattering of frozen regions and swampy marshlands. To the west, a harsh desert lies against the High Dragon’s Teeth, while scattered cities orbit around a large inland sea to the northwest. In addition to a thriving overworld, Egar boasts a large complex of tunnels, caverns, and ruins that make up its own local pocket of the Underdark (with the Underdark being the only land route to the Minio, the other continent in its hemisphere). </p>

          <p>Like its oldest terrain fixtures, life on Egar is also young. The gods, having spent millennia resting after creating their world, slowly took their time creating life on each continent, focusing on Egar last. For some time, at least a thousand years as scholars tell it, Egar was only populated by monsters and creatures of their ilk. Long lived hobgoblins can recall times told by their ancestors before the common races appeared, where great goblinoid empires reigned over the land. Of the [player] races, Haflings are some of the oldest, having supposedly been created by Agor (god of agriculture and family bonds) in -2260 ET. Elves and Dwarves were not far behind, appearing in the -2100’s. Between -2050 ET and 0 ET, a great era of new life flourished throughout the continent. Dragonborn descended from their draconic ancestors, Gnomes emerged from great underground burrows, Tieflings emerged from the night, and Humans crawled from their caves to create new civilizations. Even life from Minio, in the form of Tabaxi, Kenku, Lizardfolk, and Tortles appeared over time.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="mainText">
            <p>Due to the variety of races present in Egar, hundreds of deities are worshipped around the continent. Though each race has their own special pantheon of gods, most civilizations accept a select few as the prime pantheon on Egar. This pantheon is accredited as the original children of Yondur and encompasses gods from different races and regions. One such goddess, the aforementioned Nesia, is a goddess originally worshiped by the original tribal people of the Urkbauer Empire. When this empire rose to prominence on the western part of the continent, Nesia too rose in prominence as a deity.</p>
